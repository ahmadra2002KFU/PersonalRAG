# Hospital RAG System - Progress Report

## Project Overview
Integration of MedGemma-4B-IT-GGUF model and RAGFlow-compatible embedding models into the Hospital RAG System.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Model Configuration Updates ✅
- **File**: `hospital_rag/config/settings.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Set `MedGemma-4B-IT-GGUF` as the primary medical model
  - Updated embedding models to RAGFlow-compatible versions:
    - Primary: `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`
    - Medical: `BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5`
  - Set `MedGemma-4B` as the default model
  - Reordered available models to prioritize MedGemma

### 2. Model Loader Implementation ✅
- **File**: `hospital_rag/backend/model_loader.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added GGUF support with `llama-cpp-python` import
  - Fixed logger initialization order
  - Updated `load_medgemma_model()` function to load `SandLogicTechnologies/MedGemma-4B-IT-GGUF`
  - Implemented dual-path response generation for GGUF and standard models
  - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Dependencies Installation ✅
- **File**: `requirements.txt`
- **Added packages**:
  - `llama-cpp-python` - GGUF model support
  - `gguf` - GGUF format handling
  - `ctransformers` - Additional transformer support
- **Installation**: Successfully installed all GGUF dependencies

### 4. Application Startup Configuration ✅
- **File**: `hospital_rag/backend/main.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enabled MedGemma model loading as primary AI model
  - Added error handling for model loading
  - Kept Qwen model loading commented to prioritize MedGemma

### 5. System Testing ✅
- **Status**: Application successfully started
- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:8000
- **Model Loading**: MedGemma-4B-IT-GGUF model loaded successfully
- **Data Processing**: 358 hospital documents loaded
- **Preview**: Web interface accessible and functional

## Issues Resolved

### 6. Git Configuration and Repository Setup ✅
- **Issue**: Git errors when adding files due to:
  - Line ending conversion warnings (LF to CRLF)
  - Virtual environment directory access issues
  - Missing .gitignore file
- **Solution**:
  - Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude:
    - Virtual environment (`hospital_rag_env/`)
    - Python cache files (`__pycache__/`)
    - Model files (`*.gguf`, `*.bin`, etc.)
    - IDE and OS specific files
  - Configured Git for Windows: `git config core.autocrlf true`
  - Reset and re-added files with proper exclusions
- **Result**: Successfully staged all project files without errors

## Technical Implementation Details

### GGUF Model Support
- Implemented conditional loading based on `GGUF_AVAILABLE` flag
- Added fallback to BioGPT-Large if GGUF loading fails
- Proper error handling and logging throughout the process

### Embedding Model Integration
- Updated to use BAAI BGE models which are optimized for:
  - Medical content understanding
  - RAGFlow compatibility
  - Better semantic search performance

### Model Priority Configuration
- MedGemma-4B-IT-GGUF set as primary model
- Qwen3-1.7B available as secondary option
- Default model configuration points to MedGemma

## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: All integration tasks successfully implemented and tested

## Next Steps (If Needed)
- Monitor model performance in production
- Fine-tune embedding model parameters if needed
- Consider adding more medical-specific models
- Optimize memory usage for large model deployments
